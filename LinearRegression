#Logistic Regression in Machine Learning 
  When I first watch A.NG's M-L lectures, I found that in his video, logistic regression and linear regression has the same updatae rule, which is strange to me at that time. So, I refered some other materials and finally I found a solution. This is a summary of what I've learned.
##1.WHAT  IS LOGISTIC REGRESSION
Just as A.NG showed in his slides, logistic regression is used to classify several groups, which is supervised learning at the same time.

Usualy we use below to update $\theta$

$\theta =  \theta -  \alpha * {{dJ(\theta)}\over{d\theta}}\tag{online available}$

$x^2\tag{online available}$                                         

$I = x+3\tag{How does it works}$
